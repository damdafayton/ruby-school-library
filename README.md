# School Library

Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that you will create will allow you to:

- Add new students or teachers.
- Add new books.
- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way!

## Built With

- Ruby

## How to run

```
git clone https://github.com/damdafayton/ruby-school-library
cd ruby-school-library
```

`./main.rb`

If that doesnt work

`ruby ./main.rb`
